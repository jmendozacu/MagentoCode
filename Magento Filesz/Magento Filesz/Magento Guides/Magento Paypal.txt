PayPal Express Checkout 
- when your customers check out, they will be directed to a page that requires them to log into their PayPal account or create a new one. 
Therefore, this is the best option if you anticipate that most of your customers either have a PayPal account or will sign up for an account on checkout.
It may also improve sales; according to PayPal’s website, the Express Checkout button "can increase sales by 14% on average*" 
and has "conversion rates [that] are 23% higher than standard checkout at some of today's largest online retailers.**"

PayPal Website Payments Standard
- when your customers check out, they will be directed to a page that allows them to log into their PayPal account or pay by credit card without 
having to sign up for a PayPal account. 
This is the best option if you anticipate that most of your customers will not want to sign up for a PayPal account.
