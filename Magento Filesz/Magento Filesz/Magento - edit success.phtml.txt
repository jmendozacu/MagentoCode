1. go to Mage_Checkout_OnepageController::successAction()

2. Comment the line $session->clear();. Now you can make one order and refresh the page as often as you like.

3. If you do not even want to make an order on each browser, for example when doing cross-browser testing, you also can just initialize the session every time.

Pick an order id and a quote id from the table sales_flat_order (fields: ?entity_id and quote_id) and change the beginning of the function as follows:

$session = $this->getOnepage()->getCheckout();

$session->setLastSuccessQuoteId(INSERT_QUOTE_ID);
$session->setLastQuoteId(INSERT_QUOTE_ID);
$session->setLastOrderId(INSERT_ORDER_ID);
and replaceINSERT_.... with the IDs.

Now you can always call checkout/onepage/success
